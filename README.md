MATLAB files for "Stackelberg Security Investment Game for Networked Control Systems with Model Uncertainty"
The Supplemental document contains details of the New Engalnd system along with the generation of the uncertain models varying the loads. It also contains the diversity degree of the models in the model set M. 
The .mat file for the nominla system contains the matrices A, B1, B2 along with design matrices Q,R for the H2 controller design.
The nonlinear data .m file contains the parameter change values for each of the loads.
In the branch "Uncertain-systems"  : The .mat files for the uncertain systems are generated by pushing the load values in the nonlinear file to critical values.
