# Stackelberg-Game-Power-models
MATLAB data files for "A Robust Stackelberg Investment Game for Cyber-Security of Networked Control Systems".
This repository contains data files of 20 randonmly generated uncertain models for the IEEE 39-bus system and 20 for the IEEE 68-bus system.
These data files are used in the performance analysis of the proposed Stackelberg Investment game on time-varying model uncertainty of electric power systems.
